Dear sir

I am writing this letter to inform and to get permission to take a 6 days of leave starting from 24/06/2022 to 29/06/2022 because of some personal reasons.

I hope you will understand my situation and grant me leave for 6 days. I will return to the work immediately after the leave i.e  on 30/06/2022.
